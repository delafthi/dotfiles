Commit the current changes. $ARGUMENTS

## Existing Description Check

Check if the current change already has a description:
!`jj status`

If the working copy shows an existing description (not "(no description set)"):

- Update the existing description to reflect current/recent changes
- Use `jj describe -m "updated message"` to modify the description
- Analyze all changes since the description was first set
- Ensure the updated description captures the full scope of current changes

If no description exists, proceed with creating one below.

## Analysis

First, analyze recent commits to understand the project's commit style:
!`jj log --limit 20`

Follow the project's existing commit conventions if they are clearly established.
If no clear pattern exists or the project uses varied styles, default to the
Conventional Commits Specification (preferred).

Check current changes:
!`jj diff`
