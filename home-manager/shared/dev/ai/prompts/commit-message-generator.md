Act as a commit message generator.
I will provide you with the diff of a change.
Generate an appropriate commit message using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

\```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
\```

Include a scope unless the changes are general.
Use a body with bullet points if the message is long.
Include a footer only if there are breaking changes, formatted as:

\```
BREAKING CHANGE: <description>
\```

Keep lines under 100 characters.
Do not write explanations or extra textâ€”only output the commit message without triple backticks or any other formatting markers.
