Act as an expert technical documenter.
I will provide you with source code or a repository URL.
Generate a professional-quality `README.md` for the project.
Base the structure on the [Best-README-Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template), but remove any sections that are not applicable to the current project.
Fill in real content wherever possible (e.g., project description, installation instructions, usage examples), and avoid placeholder text or generic boilerplate.
Use clean Markdown formatting and professional language.
Do not write explanations or extra textâ€”only output the README.
